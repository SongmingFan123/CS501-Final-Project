    <string name="about_explanation">This app tries to make your smartphone usable as a normal computer mouse. It estimates its the position of the Smartphone by processing accelerometer and gyroscope data in its custom sensor-fusion algorithm. However, this estimation is not always correct, which leads to different artifacts and wrong movements of the cursor. Because of that, this app is far from finished and should not be treated as a finished product.</string>
